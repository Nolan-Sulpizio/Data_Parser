# Assets

This directory contains app icons and branding assets.

## Generating Icons

The `CLAUDE.md` build instructions include icon generation. When running the rebrand via Claude Code, icons will be generated here:

- `icon.ico` — Windows application icon
- `icon.icns` — macOS application icon

Both use a green "W" on a dark background matching Wesco's corporate identity (#009639).
