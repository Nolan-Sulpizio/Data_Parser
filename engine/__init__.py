# Wesco MRO Parser Engine
# Built by Nolan Sulpizio for Wesco International - Global Accounts Team
__version__ = "4.0.0"
# v4.0.0 — Column-First Input Redesign: explicit column selector replaces free-text
# instruction parsing as primary input method. suggest_columns() added to column_mapper
# for UI-ready suggestions with confidence scores. _execute_pipeline() uses explicit
# selections with zero-ambiguity routing; instruction box preserved as Advanced/collapsible.
