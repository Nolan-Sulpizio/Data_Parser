__version__ = "3.5.0"
# v3.5.0 — Schema-Aware Routing: schema_classifier.py synthesizes column_mapper
# and file_profiler into a structural schema template (SAP_STANDARD, SAP_SHORT_TEXT,
# SAP_DUAL_SOURCE, DISTRIBUTOR_ORDER, LABELED_SPEC, GENERIC). Multiplicative weight
# merge ensures both structural and content signals must agree for strong boosts.
